TODO:
X add button for players to add card to the river.
* maybe prevent tiles to be deleted, they must be discarded (or discard on deletion?)
X add way to take a card back from the table to the river.
* sync river after discard hand from GM
X limit right click options on river cards.
* allow boosted rolls from character sheet UI
X allow skill check to boost with suit
X skills have a score now and can be rolled
X improve statuses (injury, etc) to show stress mitigation and description of what it does?
* connections can be rolled and have a score
X moxie is now called stress
* see cards in chat would be nice
X show river cards differently in the hand and table would be a plus
* Compute impact of statuses into rolls
* Inventory list UI
* Contact list UI and Roll and Model

BUGS:
* Clicking fast can go over river limits (hard to reproduce)
X Dropping cards x,y position is in relation to local screen, not GM's screen, which means the card is dropped wherever.
* Notes is written all smol
X when player draw cards from their deck its finnicky... there is certainly an issue with slots because I lose 1 card if the GM adds 4 cards to river and I draw 3 from deck from a player, i lose 1 river card...
* sometimes there are two deck folders at start and it causes issue with the playerdeck game id
X flow de take envoie pas l'event de sync de river... pas considéré comme dans river jusqu'à temps qu'on add-to-river chatMessageOnPlayerAction
X les pecnauds voient pas la river en bleu
